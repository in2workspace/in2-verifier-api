# Introduction

Spring Authentication Server is a framework that provides implementations of the **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect 1.0** specifications, as well as other related standards.  
It is built on top of **Spring Security** to provide a secure, lightweight, and customizable foundation for building **OpenID Connect 1.0 Identity Providers** and **OAuth 2 Authentication Server** products.

Our **Verifier** builds upon this robust foundation, extending it with additional functionalities from **OpenID Connect Core** and **OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)**.

This enhancement enables the Verifier to support authentication workflows between clients and users based on **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**. By combining these standards, the Verifier creates a robust and secure system for managing digital identities, allowing users to authenticate seamlessly while ensuring the integrity and verifiability of their credentials.

With the Verifier, organizations can leverage:
- **OpenID Connect Core** for traditional client-user authentication.
- **OpenID4VP** for presenting and validating tamper-proof digital credentials.  
  This unique combination positions the Verifier as a versatile and modern solution for both centralized and decentralized authentication scenarios.


## Verifier Interaction Methods

The verifier interacts with clients in two ways:

1. **Using OpenID Connect Core**  
   OpenID Connect Core serves as the primary standard for authentication between clients and the verifier.  
   [Learn more about OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)

2. **Using OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)**  
   OpenID4VP enables the verifier to process verifiable presentations (VPs) containing verifiable credentials (VCs) during authentication flows.  
   [Learn more about OpenID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-20.html)

# OpenID Connect Integration

## Client Authentication Flow

The OpenID Connect integration for clients consists of two main steps:

1. **Authentication Request**
2. **Token Request**
3. **Refresh Token Request**

### Step 1: Client Registration

To interact with the verifier, a client must be registered in the verifier's client list.  
Currently, the **[DOME Trust Framework GitHub repository](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/trust-framework.git)** is used to manage the client registry.

#### Approaches for Registering Clients

There are two approaches for registering clients, depending on the needs and capabilities of the client application:

1. **Using `did:key` (Required for FAPI Profile)**  
   This approach is mandatory for clients that need to use the **Financial-grade API (FAPI)** profile of OpenID Connect.
    - **Client ID**: Use your `did:key` as the `clientId`.
    - **JWK Set URL**: Use the verifier's endpoint in the format:
      ```
      https://<domain>/oidc/did/<did:key:...>
      ```
      This endpoint allows the verifier to reconstruct the public key from the `did:key` for signature validation.
    - **Why Use `did:key`?**: This ensures compliance with FAPI requirements, offering enhanced security and interoperability by eliminating the need for a separate JWKS endpoint.

2. **Using a Unique Identifier (For Non-FAPI Clients)**  
   This approach is suitable for clients that do not require FAPI compliance or cannot support it, such as Keycloak acting as a broker.
    - **Client ID**: Use a unique identifier that clearly defines the purpose of the client (e.g., `issuer-dome`).
    - **JWK Set URL**: Provide the URL where your public keys are exposed for validation.
    - **Why Use a Unique Identifier?**: This method provides flexibility for clients that do not require the strict security guarantees of FAPI but still need to integrate securely with the verifier.

#### Which data is needed to set a new entry into the Trusted Services List?

The trusted services list contains all the verified and authorized services within the DOME ecosystem. These services have met the required standards for secure and trusted interactions. To add a new entry to the trusted services list, specific information must be provided in a YAML file, adhering to the structure outlined below:

| **Field**                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **clientId**                                    | Should be a `did:key` or a unique identifier for your client. Using a `did:key` allows the verifier to obtain your public keys for signature verification without needing a separate JWKS endpoint.                                                                                        |
| **url**                                         | The base URL of your service or application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **redirectUris**                                | Must include all the URLs where you expect to receive authentication responses. These should be HTTPS URLs to ensure secure communication.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **scopes**                                      | Currently, only `openid_learcredential` is accepted. This scope allows your service to request the necessary credentials.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **clientAuthenticationMethods**                 | Must be set to `["client_secret_jwt"]`, as this is the only supported authentication method.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **authorizationGrantTypes**                     | Must be set to `["authorization_code"]` and `["refresh_token"]` if needed, as this is the only supported grant type.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **postLogoutRedirectUris**                      | Include URLs where users should be redirected after they log out from your service.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **requireAuthorizationConsent**                 | Set to `false` because explicit user consent is not required in this flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **requireProofKey**                             | Set to `false` as PKCE is not utilized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **jwkSetUrl**                                   | If you're using a `did:key` for your `clientId`, you do not need to provide a `jwkSetUrl` because the verifier can derive your JWKS directly from the `did:key`. However, if you're not using a unique identifier, you must provide the `jwkSetUrl` where your public keys can be fetched. |
| **tokenEndpointAuthenticationSigningAlgorithm** | Must be set to `ES256`, as this is the only supported algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### How to add the client to the Trusted Services List

Once the necessary data is collected, you can proceed to submit a Pull Request (PR) to the **[DOME Trust Framework GitHub repository](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/trust-framework.git)** to add the new client to the Trusted Services List. The repository serves as the central place for managing trusted clients within the **DOME** ecosystem.

Follow these steps to submit the PR:
1. Fork the **[DOME Trust Framework GitHub repository](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/trust-framework.git)**.
2. Add the new client entry (in YAML format) to the `clients` section.
3. Submit the PR for review and approval.

Once the PR is merged, the new client will be added to the trusted services list and will be able to interact with the verifier.

---

#### Example YAML Entry

Below is an example of how to define a client in the trusted services list:

```yaml
clients:
  - clientId: "did:key:zDnaeypyWjzn54GuUP7PmDXiiggCyiG7ksMF7Unm7kjtEKBez"
    url: "https://dome-marketplace-sbx.org"
    redirectUris: ["https://dome-marketplace-sbx.org/auth/vc/callback"]
    scopes: ["openid_learcredential"]
    clientAuthenticationMethods: ["client_secret_jwt"]
    authorizationGrantTypes: ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]
    postLogoutRedirectUris: ["https://dome-marketplace-sbx.org/"]
    requireAuthorizationConsent: false
    requireProofKey: false
    jwkSetUrl: "https://verifier.dome-marketplace-sbx.org/oidc/did/did:key:zDnaeypyWjzn54GuUP7PmDXiiggCyiG7ksMF7Unm7kjtEKBez"
    tokenEndpointAuthenticationSigningAlgorithm: "ES256"
```

---

### Step 2: Authentication and Token Requests

Once the client is registered, the authentication flow proceeds as follows:

1. **Authentication Request**
    - The client sends an Authentication request to the verifier.
    - The verifier authenticates the user, presenting a login screen where the user must use their wallet to provide a valid credential.
    - This process utilizes the **OpenID4VP flow**, where the user presents their verifiable credential (VC) to authenticate.
    - If the authentication is successful, the verifier sends an **authentication response** to the client's redirection URL (`redirect_uri`).

2. **Token Request**
    - After receiving the authentication response, the client submits a token request to the verifier.
    - The client includes its **Client Assertion JWT**, which the verifier uses to validate the request's origin and integrity.
    - If validated, the verifier issues a **token response**, containing the necessary information for the client to authenticate the user within their platform.

---

## Supported Scopes

The verifier currently supports the following scopes:

1. **Mandatory Scope**:
    - `openid learcredential` this scope is required for authentication and for accessing the user's credential data.

2. **Optional Scopes**:
    - `profile`
    - `email`

Including the optional scopes ensures that the **ID Token** contains basic user information such as the user's name and email address. This facilitates integration with other Identity Providers.
> **Note:** The optional scopes (`profile` and `email`) must always be used in combination with the `learcredential` scope.

---

## Token Response Data Model

When a client requests a token with the scopes `openid learcredential profile email`, the **token response** will include the following fields:

### Example Token Response

```
{
"access_token": "eyJra...",
"id_token": "eyJra.....",
"token_type": "Bearer",
"expires_in": 18000
}
```

### Access Token Payload

The `access_token` payload will have a similar structure:

```
{
"aud": "did:key:zDn...",
"sub": "did:key:zDn...",
"scope": "openid learcredential",
"iss": "http://localhost:9000",
"exp": 1732848838,

},
"jti": "c8a011b6-2a88-418d-840e-68e0b81b39d1"
}
```

> **Key Point:** The `vc` claim in the payload contains the user's verifiable credential, which can be used to extract relevant information about the user.

---

### ID Token Payload

The `id_token` includes basic user information and the verifiable credential in JSON string format.

```
{
"sub": "did:key:zDn..",
"vc_json": "{\"@context\":[\"https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2\",\"https://dome-marketplace.eu/2022/credentials/learcredential/v1\"],\"expirationDate\":\"2024-10-17T12:20:08.408517084Z\",\"id\":\"a96f4f04-258f-4367-8a20-d2998e9cc759\",\"issuanceDate\":\"2024-09-17T12:20:08.408517084Z\",\"issuer\":\"did:elsi:VAT...\",\"type\":[\"LEARCredentialEmployee\",\"VerifiableCredential\"],\"validFrom\":\"2024-09-17T12:20:08.408517084Z\"}",
"email_verified": true,

"exp": 1732831138,
"iat": 1732830838,
"family_name": "Doe",
"email": "jhondoe@gmail.es"
}
```

> **Key Point:** The `vc_json` attribute contains the Verifiable Credential (VC) as a JSON string. This format simplifies storing the credential in systems like Keycloak or other Identity Providers without requiring custom mappers or extensions.

---

## Supported Features

The verifier implements the **Authentication using the Authentication Code Flow** from OpenID Connect Core. Additionally, it supports key features from the **Financial-grade API (FAPI) Profile**, including:

- **Authentication Request as JWTs**

---

# OpenID4VP Integration

## H2M Flow (Human-to-Machine Login)

Currently, the verifier supports **H2M login flow** where a user authenticates with a verifiable presentation.  
The following restrictions and configurations are applied in this flow:

1. **VP Token Format**:
    - The verifier only accepts VP tokens in **JWT_VP format**.
    - The VP must include a **LEARCredential** in **JWT_VC format**.

2. **Presentation Definition**:
    - The presentation definition is currently ignored.
    - Wallets can generate the VP without needing to interpret a presentation definition from the verifier.

3. **Scope for Credential Presentation**:
    - The verifier uses the scope `dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredentialEmployee`.
    - This scope ensures compatibility with different wallets, allowing them to generate the required VP.

4. **Response Mode**:
    - The verifier uses `direct_post` as the response mode.
    - This indicates that the authentication response must be sent directly to the verifier's endpoint specified in the `response_uri`.

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alias**                  | A name to identify the Identity Provider.                                                          |
| **Use discovery endpoint** | Recommended if the Identity Provider provides a Discovery Endpoint to avoid manual configurations. |
| **Discovery endpoint**     | The endpoint where the IDP's data can be found.                                                    |

Here is an example of the configuration:

#### Client Authentication

- **Client Authentication:** Select `JWT signed with private key`.
- **Client ID:** Use the unique identifier you will register in the DOME Trust Framework (e.g., `issuer-dome`).
- **Client Secret:** Not needed since we will use `JWT signed with private key`.
- **Client Assertion Signature Algorithm:** Select `ES256`, which is supported by the verifier.
- **Client Assertion Audience:** Use the equivalent of the issuer obtained in the discovery.

#### Important Note

**Leave the Logout URL field blank.**

The Logout URL field is automatically completed by Keycloak if it is not left blank. This causes issues that prevent logout functionality from working correctly. To avoid this, ensure the Logout URL field is left **empty**, as shown below:

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background: #f9f9f9;">
    <img src="docs/images/logout-url-empty.png" alt="Logout URL Field Left Blank">
</div>

### Step 3: Configure Advanced Settings

1. Go to **Advanced settings**:
    - **Access Token is JWT:** Set to `On`.
    - **Trust Email:** Set to `On`.
    <div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background: #f9f9f9;">
        <img src="docs/images/advanced-settings.png" alt="Advanced Settings - Access Token and Trust Email">
    </div>

2. Go to **OpenID Connect settings > Advanced**:
    - **Disable user info:** Set to `On`.
    - **Disable nonce:** Set to `On`.
    - **Scopes:** Add `learcredential profile email`.

      Including **profile** and **email** in the scopes ensures that the **ID Token** contains the basic user information required to create a user in Keycloak. This includes details such as the user's name and email address, which are essential for creating a basic user profile.

### Step 4: Configure the Mappers

Mappers allow you to extract information from the IDP and use it for local users. The following types will be used:

#### 4.1. Attribute Importer

- **Claim:** The location of the value to retrieve, e.g., `vc.credentialSubject.mandate.mandator.organizationIdentifier`.
- **User Attribute Name:** The user attribute to which the retrieved value will be associated, e.g., `organizationIdentifier`.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background: #f9f9f9;">
    <img src="docs/images/attribute-importer.png" alt="Attribute Importer Configuration">
</div>

#### 4.2. Hardcoded Attribute

- **User Attribute:** The attribute to which you want to assign a default value.
- **User Attribute Value:** The desired value.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background: #f9f9f9;">
    <img src="docs/images/hardcoded-attribute-importer.png" alt="Hardcoded Attribute Configuration">
</div>

#### 4.3. Username Template Importer

- **Template:** Use the claim `${CLAIM.email}` to extract the email sent by the IDP.
- **Target:** Specify the target field as `BROKER_ID`.

This ensures the link between the user and their Verifiable Credential (VC) is based on the email rather than the `sub` of the ID Token, allowing a user to have multiple VCs associated.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background: #f9f9f9;">
    <img src="docs/images/username-template-importer.png" alt="Username Template Importer Configuration">
</div>

#### 4.4. Sync Mode Override

- **Import:** Adds data only during the user's first login. This is the most common use case.
- **Force:** Overwrites data with each login. Useful if a user has multiple credentials for different purposes and wants to use the one they select during login.

## Section 2: Registering the Client on the DOME Trust Framework

Once you have completed the Keycloak configuration, you must register the client, for this registration, you must follow **Step 1: Client Registration** as outlined in the **[README](https://github.com/in2workspace/in2-verifier-api/blob/main/README.md#step-1-client-registration)**. Specifically, you should follow the **second approach** (using a unique identifier).

This step is essential for enabling the client to interact securely with the verifier.
